This program scans through an entire pdf file and creates excel files of all the tables it finds.

TO RUN:
Make sure the pdf file is in the same folder as the program otherwise it will not find the file. 
When the program is run it will ask for the name of the file (Do not include the .pdf). Type in the files name and hit enter.
The program will create excel files for anything it thought was a table in the same folder.
This program utilizes 2 Python Libraries camelot and PyPDF2.
Links to their respective github pages and how to install: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot and https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2

LIMITATIONS:
There are often false positives and it will create tables from something that wasn't a table.
If a table doesn't extend across the entire width of the page it will make an extra column. (This is easy to fix afterword by simply deleting the column)
When there is text that spans multiple lines but is within the same row the program will think each line is it's own row. As such this program works best
with number data tables and not words.
